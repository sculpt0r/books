# "Hello, Startup", Yevgeniy Brikman

> Thereâ€™s a big difference between building a business and solving interesting engineering problems. There are interesting engineering problems in startups, but very frequently, your business will not succeed or fail based on how well you solve those engineering problems.

> A problem well stated is a problem half solved.

> Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration.

> "If you're not embarrassed by your first release, you've launched too late" - Reid Hoffman

> It's a little bit like **sculpting**. You start with a huge block of marble and you need to chip away at it, day by day, until you've finally revealed the statue that was within the rock (and within your mind).
